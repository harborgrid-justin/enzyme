# Initialize Your Enzyme Project

Welcome to Enzyme! Let's get your project set up.

## What you'll need

- Node.js 18 or higher
- A React project or empty directory
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and React

## Initialize Enzyme

You can initialize Enzyme in two ways:

### 1. New Project

Run the command **Enzyme: Initialize Enzyme Project** from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P).

This will:
- Create an `enzyme.config.ts` file
- Set up the project structure
- Install necessary dependencies
- Configure routing and authentication

### 2. Existing Project

If you already have a React project:
1. Run **Enzyme: Initialize Enzyme Project**
2. Choose "Add to existing project"
3. Select your configuration options

## Next Steps

After initialization:
- Explore the Enzyme sidebar
- Generate your first component
- Set up authentication
- Create routes
