# Initialize Enzyme Project

Starting a new Enzyme project? The initialization wizard will set up everything you need.

## What Gets Created

- **enzyme.config.ts**: Main configuration file
- **Project Structure**: Organized folders (features, routes, components, stores, api)
- **TypeScript Config**: Optimized tsconfig.json
- **Dependencies**: Essential Enzyme packages

## Configuration Options

During initialization, you'll be asked about:
- Project name and description
- Auth provider (JWT, OAuth, SAML)
- State management preferences
- API configuration
- Testing framework (Vitest or Jest)
- CSS framework (Tailwind, CSS Modules, Styled Components, Emotion)

## After Initialization

Once initialized:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Begin building features!
