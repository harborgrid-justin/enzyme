# Claude.ai Project Guide

## Project Structure
This is an enterprise React framework called Enzyme with the following optimized structure:

### Core Directories
- `src/` - Main library source code with modular architecture
- `.development/` - Development tools (CLI and demo apps)
- `docs/` - Documentation and analysis files
- `scripts/` - Build and utility scripts
- `test/` - Test configuration and utilities

### Key Features for AI Assistance
- **Import Aliases**: Use `@/` for `src/` imports (e.g., `@/lib/auth`)
- **Modular Architecture**: Each feature in `src/lib/` has its own index file
- **TypeScript Strict**: Maximum type safety with comprehensive linting
- **Dual Builds**: ESM and CommonJS outputs for maximum compatibility
- **Enterprise Patterns**: Advanced routing, state management, authentication

### Development Workflow
1. `npm run dev` - Start development server
2. `npm run build` - Build for production
3. `npm run test` - Run test suite
4. `npm run lint` - Check code quality
5. `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript validation

### Code Quality Standards
- ESLint with TypeScript and React rules
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- Vitest for testing with coverage requirements
- No barrel imports (enforced by custom ESLint rule)

### AI-Friendly Features
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Clear file organization
- Consistent naming conventions
- Well-documented configuration files</content>
